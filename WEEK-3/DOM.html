    <h1>What is DOM and its working ? </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The DOM is an application programming interface(API) for manipulating HTML and XML documents.</li>
        <li>This manipulation can be adding, removing, and modifying parts of the HTML document.</li>
        <li>Understanding DOM concept will give us an insight of the use of JS in making changes in our website.</li>
        <li>When a webpage is loaded, the browser creates a tree-like structure called as DOM of the page.</li>
        <li>The tags in HTML became the objects in DOM.</li>
        <li>So, those objects can be manipulated by using inbuilt methods and properties.</li>
